## Code Challenge: Stacks and Queues

#### Author
Trevor Stam

### Feature Tasks

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node
- Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.

    - This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
    - Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
    - Define a method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node.
    - Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the node located on the top of the stack.

- Create a Queue class that has a top property. It creates an empty queue when instantiated.

    - This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
    - Define a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
    - Define a method called dequeue that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node.
    - Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the node located in the front of the stack.
