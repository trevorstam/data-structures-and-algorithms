## Code Challenge: Linked Lists

### Trevor Stam

## Feature tasks:
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
* Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
    * This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to head when the linked list is instantiated.
    * Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
    * Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
    * Define a method called print which takes in no arguments and outputs all of the current Node values in the Linked List.
    * At no time should an exception or stack trace be shown to the end user. Catch and handle any such exceptions and return a printed value or operation which cleanly represents the state and either stops execution cleanly, or provides the user with clear direction and output.
    * Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).
